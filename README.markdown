# Bláthy

A personal iPhone web application to monitor my energy usage. This application should help me to write down the current energy meters in the house at the beginning of each month: water, electricity, solar power and gas. One see some [screenshots](http://emberapp.com/explore/tags/blathy)?

I'll focus on input for now but this will be only useful when I have some reporting over time.

## Naming

The application is named after [Ottó Titusz Bláthy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Blathy), the Hungarian co-inventor of the watt meter.

## Ideas to implement

- A crontab that sends an e-mail at the beginning of each month.
- Reporting functionality.
- Compare last month with the same month last year.
- Make this a hosted application with multiple users.
